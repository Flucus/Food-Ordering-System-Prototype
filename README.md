# Food-Ordering-System-Prototype

The program simulates the ordering process for the restaurant. It allows customers to place food orders by phone, and the operator enters the order information into the system. The program assigns priority indicators to each order and determines the order in which they should be delivered.

The prototype program includes functionalities such as processing ordering, printing out order lists, deleting orders, and quitting the program. It also incorporates membership features, including different priority indicators for VIP members, registered members, and guests. The program validates input for member IDs, food selections, and order deletion. Additionally, an exceptional class, InvalidInputException, has been created to handle validation exceptions.
